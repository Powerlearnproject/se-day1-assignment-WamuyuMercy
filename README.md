Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is a structured approach to designing, developing, testing, implementing and maintaining software systems that help solve problems. It plays a vital role in the technology industry by driving innovation that brings business efficiency and solves real-world challenges by building scalable and high-performance solutions.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of software engineering - 1950s-60s - early software was written in machine code and assembly language 
Development of software development methodologies -  1970s - 80s - Structured programming emerged, improving software design and maintainability. It included methodologies such as the waterfall model.
Agile and Devops Revolution - 1990s - present - Agile methodologies revolutionised software development. DevOps, AI-driven development and cloud computing have transformed software engineering into a more dynamic and iterative process, enhancing collaboration among developers and generally making work easier. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identifying the goals, risks and feasibility of the project
Requirements analysis - gathering and defining functional and non-functional requirements
Design - creating architecture and system models -UI/UX designs fall here too.
Implementation/Coding - writing and compiling the software
Testing - ensuring the software is bug-free and meets the requirements
Maintenance - Updating and improving the software based on changing user requirements as well as feedback

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach to software engineering where each phase is totally completed before moving to the next phase. An example scenario would be a banking software whose requirements are well-defined from top to bottom. On the other hand, agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development which allows for continuous feedback and flexibility. It is more suitable for projects with evolving requirements, such as a health industry mobile application that is AI-driven and requires adjustments per patient health. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes, tests and maintains code based on project requirements. A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality through testing and identifying defects. A project manager oversees project timelines, resource allocation and team coordination to ensure goals are met within the stipulated time and budget

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments streamline development by providing tools such as code editors, debuggers and compilers. Examples include VS Code, IntelliJ. Version control systems help track and manage changes in code, allowing for collaboration by developers and rolling back in case a change affects the software. Examples include Git, Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines - implementing agile development methodology and time management techniques helps deliver projects within the tight deadlines
Complexity of codebase - Following coding best practices, documenting every step and modular programming can help manage the complexity
Changing user requirements - Following agile development methodology helps accommodate changing user requirements
Security Risks - implement secure coding practices -security by design - and perform regular audits
Team collaboration challenges - implement collaboration, work management and communication tools such as Jira, Slack and version control tools

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - tests individual components of the software, ensuring the small parts work correctly before integration
Integration testing - tests interactions between different modules to verify they work together as expected. 
System testing -  evaluates the entire system against the requirements to ensure it functions as a whole
Acceptance testing - determines that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.

The importance of testing in software quality assurance is to help identify and fix defects in the software early enough to make the final product reliable and enhance user satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts for AI models to optimize their performance. It is important because AI responses are dependent on how well the instructions are put and the structure in play. Well-crafted prompts lead to relevant and accurate results or useful outputs, improving both the AI efficiency and user satisfaction.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about history
Improved prompt: Provide a historical summary of World War 1, including its causes, major events, and its impact on global politics.
The improved prompt has a clear topic, asks for specific things and removes ambiguity, ensuring a relevant AI response.
